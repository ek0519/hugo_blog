<p>骑士之死</p>

<p>英雄的骨灰留在亚洲
他们的灵魂从南京升入天堂
省去过多的副词和形容词
只剩身后的祭坛和坟墓
和一个叫约书亚的男人</p>

<p>我们是在粉尘中敬仰
在孟浪的怀疑里前行
我们愧对爱上的女子
直到临死之前也没有
完成她所托付的任务</p>

<p>必须感谢去耶路撒冷的人
感谢那些被杀的，冲动的
把其他部分卷进朝圣的行囊中
为无主之地带来国王的人
感谢他们的虔诚和庞大</p>

<p>尽管他们的衬衣不够白
如果仔细，可以发现一丝血渍
权当骑士披上的红斗篷
不过他们伟大的棕色裤子
确如将他们埋葬的大地一样庄严</p>

<p>仍然活着的人错在哪里呢
我想，是因为我们厌恶未来
才把生命活成了一门手艺
当圣徒发出夺目的光芒时
有人羞愧，有人变了颜色</p>

<p>哦，伟大的葛伦和他的主人亚瑟
伟大的罗宾汉和他效忠的查理
那个哼着绿袖子，寻遍每座城堡
的朋友在哪里呢？我必须承认
我被你的友情深深冒犯了</p>

<p>The death of a knight</p>

<p>Author: Pastor Wang Yi</p>

<pre><code>      --For Boguang Li and knights of this era
</code></pre>

<p>The ashes of heroes remain in Asia,
Their souls, through Nanking, ascend to heaven
The redundant adjectives and adverbs omitted,
Only the tomb and the altar are left,
With a man whose name is Joshua</p>

<p>In dust are we admiring,
In the doubts of impudence are we proceeding
To the beloved maiden are we guilty
Not fulfilling her entrusted duty,
Not until death</p>

<p>Thanked are those who trek to Jerusalem,
Thanked are those who are impulsive, who are killed,
The rest are all rolled into the bag of Pilgrimage.
Those who bring a king to a land, where there is no lord,
Thanked are their piety and enormity</p>

<p>Their shirts not whitened though,
A taint of blood, if you watch closely
In replacement of the knights’ red cloak
But their great brown trousers
Are as solemn as the earth that bury them</p>

<p>What is wrong with those who are still alive
I believe, we find the future distasteful,
So we live the life into a trade
When saints shining with dazzling lights
Some ashamed, some discolored their faces</p>

<p>Oh, the great Glenn and his Lord Arthur
The Great Robinhood and the Charlie he alleged royalty
Where is the friend, searching every Castle,
Singing the Greensleeves?
This I have to admit,
I’m offended by his friendship deeply.</p>

<p>The Death of a Knight</p>

<p>By: Pastor Wang Yi</p>

<pre><code>                      --For Li Boguang and knights of this era
</code></pre>

<p>The ashes of heroes are strewn throughout Asia,
their souls from Nanjing ascend into Heaven.
Superfluous adverbs and adjectives are stricken
leaving nothing but an altar, a tomb,
and a man named Joshua.</p>

<p>We admire from the dust.
We progress in impetuous doubt,
ashamed to face our beloved.
The task she has entrusted is unfinished,
even unto death.</p>

<p>Thank those who journey to Jerusalem.
Thank those who are killed, who are quickened,
who roll up the rest in their pilgrimage bag,
bringing a king to a land without a lord.
Thank them for their piety and their immensity.</p>

<p>Although their shirts are not pure white,
look closely and you’ll see that they are tinged with blood,
like red cloaks worn by knights.
And yet their great brown trousers
are as solemn as the earth that buries them.</p>

<p>What is wrong with those who are still living?
I think we abhor the future,
turning life into a trade.
When the saints emit dazzling light,
some men are ashamed, and some change color.</p>

<p>Oh, the great Glenn and his lord Arthur!
The great Robin Hood, loyal to Charlie!
Where is that friend humming Greensleeves,
scouring every castle? I must admit,
I am deeply offended by his friendship.</p>
