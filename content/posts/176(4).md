URGENT: Please Pray for the Persecuted Church in China. After teaching last week in China, my plane left on Saturday. I learned on my layover in LA that soon after I left, Chinese police raided a prominent house church and took into custody more than 100 members and leaders of Early Rain Covenant Church, including their pastor, Wang Yi who is still in custody. -John M.
