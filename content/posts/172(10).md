发到教会信箱的一封信：
（中文翻译）

牧师，我只是个普通的信徒。我读了你写的声明，想要鼓励你。我会尽我最大的努力，把仍在进行的迫害的消息公诸于众。

我在为你祈祷，我的心沉重！！你做得很好！！坚守信仰因为你的回报是巨大的！！你激励了我，我敢肯定也激励了其他人！我只想让你知道你的信息已经传开了，并且正在蔓延世界。世界各地的信徒与你们站在一起，仿佛我们也在那里。你不是一个人受苦。我们都在经历考验，并以自己的方式被火熬炼。我正在遭遇的熬炼与你的不同，但同时也有相似之处。我想让你知道，很多人都在为你祈祷，与你站在一起！我不得不站出来写信给你们，因为我觉得你们需要知道，全世界都在支持你们国家的牧师和教会。我祈祷耶稣传遍你们的国家，千百万人悔改，生命被改变。

你的光芒明亮地照耀。

你主里的兄弟姐妹
肖恩和米歇尔

Hi pastor,

I’m just a regular believer.  I read your declaration that you wrote and was led to encourage you.  I will do my best to get the word out about the persecution that is going on still. 

You are in my prayers and heavy on my heart!! You are doing a great work!!  Keep the faith because your reward is great!! Your an inspiration to me and others I’m sure!!!  

I just want you to know that your message has gotten out and is going around the world. Believers around the world are standing with you as if we are there also.  Your not suffering alone.  We are all going through trials and being refined by the fire in our own ways.  My refining I’m going through  is different from yours but similar at the same time.  I want you to know that many are praying for you and with you!! I just had to step up and write you because I feel like you need to know that the world is standing in support of all the pastors and congregations in your country. I’m praying that Jesus sweeps through your country and repentance takes a hold and lives are changed by the millions. 

Your light shines brightly

Your brother and sister in Jesus
