**理查德·伯瑞特博士给秋雨圣约教会众弟兄姐妹的信**

蒙爱的秋雨圣约教会众弟兄姐妹，

我是理查德·伯瑞特，第三千禧年神学资源中心主席，是与你们和王怡牧师共同事奉我们主耶稣大君王的多年伙伴。你们给了我极大的荣幸让我在过去日子里能在你们中间多次事奉。

我写信要告诉你们，你们对我和你们在全世界各地的弟兄姐妹有多么大的激励。你们为基督的见证绝不会徒然。这见证正在传到地极。基督因你们以不同方式为祂站立已给你们极大的尊荣，你们的信德现在已经真的传遍了天下。

希伯来书13章3节说，“你们要记念被捆绑的人，好像与他们同受捆绑。” 

我们正在记念你们，我们亲爱的弟兄姐妹。
我们正在为你们每日祷告，为你们禁食。求主赐给你们坚强的信心，求主让那些逼迫你们的人在你们身上看见基督的荣耀，而来信靠祂。我们不断祈求，使你们的目光定睛在耶稣和我们在祂里面永生的盼望。

此生对每一个人而言都是短暂的，但我们在基督里的未来是永恒的。持守这个真理，要刚强，作大丈夫。


理查德·伯瑞特博士

Brothers and Sisters of Early Rain Covenant Church,

This is Richard Pratt, the president of Third Millennium Ministries, a Long partner with you and Pastor Wang Yi in service to our King Jesus. You have honored me with the privilege of being with you many times in the past. 

I am writing to tell you what an encouragement you are to me and to your brothers and sisters around the world. Your testimony for Christ is not in vain. It is reaching the ends of the earth. Christ has given you the great honor of standing for him in ways that are now known literally throughout the world. 

Hebrews 13:3 says, “Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them.” 

We are remembering you dear brothers and sisters. 
We are praying for you every day and fasting for you. We pray that your faith will be strong. We pray that those who persecute you will see the glory of Christ in you and come to faith in him. We are praying that you will keep your eyes fixed on Jesus and the hope of everlasting life we have in him. 

This life is short for all of us, but our future with Christ is eternal. Hold on to that truth and be strong and courageous. 

Dr. Richard Pratt
