秋雨圣约教会紧急代祷信息18号

按照圣经的吩咐，今天是主日，是敬拜上帝的日子。虽然大部分弟兄姊妹被社区监管在家，牧师传道和弟兄姊妹有十几人被监禁，但还能自由出门的弟兄姊妹照常来到江信大厦我们自己的会堂，预备一起来朝见主。

教会楼下的铁门被锁，各个路口有大量的便衣和特警，拦阻我们进会堂，并且带走了部分弟兄姊妹。随后，弟兄姊妹小范围地在附近公园聚集，也被警察拦阻，有三十多位弟兄姊妹被警察带走。

昨晚十一点，警察上一位会友家门，劝阻他明天不要去聚会，被拒绝后，把那位会友用绳子反绑压在地上带到派出所。警察昨晚还上门威胁一位被刑拘的长老的妻子不允许开放家庭聚会。这就是我们当前的环境。

主啊，今天我们在警车上敬拜你，在派出所敬拜你，在看守所敬拜你，在监狱敬拜你，也要在家里敬拜你。我们没有别的目的，只是要单单来敬拜你，坐在通往警局的大巴，如同走在锡安的大道。因为主你告诉我们，主你在寻找敬拜的人，就是在真理和圣灵里敬拜你的人。愿你悦纳我们的敬拜，我们一无所有，睢有把我们的心立刻地真诚地献上给你。

无论我，往哪里，
无论我，何境遇。
我愿一生遵行你旨意。

Early Rain Covenant Church Urgent Prayer Update #18

"According to the command of Scripture, today is the Lord’s Day, a day to worship God. Even though most brothers and sisters are under the supervision and control of community authorities at their homes, and more than a dozen brothers, sisters, pastors, and preachers are in prison, those brothers and sisters who can still freely leave their homes went to our church sanctuary in the Jiangxin Building as usual to prepare to meet the Lord.

The metal gate below the building where the church is was locked, and every entrance had many plainclothes police officers and SWAT team officers preventing people from entering the church. They took away some of the brothers and sisters. Brothers and sisters then conducted a small-scale worship meeting at a nearby park, which was also shut down by police. Police took away more than 30 brothers and sisters.

Last night at 11:00 p.m., police went to the home of a church member to advise him not to go to church the next day. After he refused, they held the church member to the ground and tied his hands behind his back with a rope before taking him to the police station. Police also went to the home of the wife of an elder who is being criminally detained and threatened her, telling her she was not allowed to open her home for worship gatherings. This is the current situation.

Lord, today we worship you in police cars. We worship you in police stations. We worship you in detention centers. We worship you in prisons. And we worship you in homes. We have no other goal except to worship you alone. We ride in buses heading to police stations as though riding down the road to Zion. For you tell us, Lord, that you are seeking worshipers who worship you in spirit and in truth. May you be pleased with our worship. We have nothing to offer you but our hearts. We offer them up sincerely to you now.

Wherever I am,
Whatever I meet,
I will follow your will forever.
