    <p>The day after Christmas, 2018
by Wanjiao Shen</p>

<p>This Christmas, I’m missing my parents more than usual. Although I have not spent Christmas with them for the past 8 years, this year is different. Mom is still in custody for “illegal business”, and dad has been taken into custody three times. He still has not been able to see her.</p>

<p>The time between now and Dec 9th has been a roller coaster ride. There was distress, heartbreak, anguish and even animosity. I was furious at the CCP, and maybe I still am. My mom has done nothing but staying true to her Christian faith and serving the congregation and the students in the seminary. “Furious” is hardly adequate to describe my feelings towards this government. I want my family back. I ask God why now, when I just completed my masters degree and landed a job; I ask Him why us, my family has gone through so much, and the hardships are finally coming to an end; I ask Him why is He allowing bad things happen to good people.</p>

<p>Scrolling through social media is especially painful. Instagram is flooded with family photos and cheesy captions. I thought to myself, how privileged are people in America. So little do they know that there are parts in the world where worship is banned and happiness is tripped away. I became cynical.</p>

<p>But this is not what Christmas is really about. It is about celebrating the One who was stripped to nothing; it is about remembering what Christ has done for us. I’ve forgotten that my life was bought with His blood. What have I done to deserve a comfortable life? Yet I complain that life is not fair, and I envy others. I am just another sinner entitled to my own happiness.</p>

<p>The world tells us it’s a season about love, giving, family. While all that is true, Christmas is really about Christ. I hear the same Christmas message at church every year, but I only heard it instead of comprehending it. I have grown accustomed to the routine, so as a gift, God made me remember.</p>

<p>This is a season about Christ. Because of Christ, I get to live the life I have. These so-called “sufferings” are nothing compare to what Christ has done. They are, in fact, blessings in disguise. I shall be thankful that God is using my parents for the great commission, and He even let me finish school first. I shall be thankful, for “Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness&rsquo; sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”</p>
